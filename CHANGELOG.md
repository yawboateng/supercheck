## [1.3.3] - 2026-03-22

> **⚠️ Breaking Change — New Execution Model**
>
> This release replaces the Docker socket-based test execution with a new sandboxed execution model powered by **K3s** and **gVisor**. Self-hosted deployments that previously used Docker Compose will need to run the new setup script (`setup-k3s.sh`) before upgrading. The worker container no longer requires access to the Docker socket.
>
> **What this means for self-hosted users:**
> - A one-time infrastructure setup is required — run `sudo bash setup-k3s.sh` on your Linux host before starting services
> - Linux (amd64/arm64) is required — Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+, or equivalent
> - The Docker Compose configuration has changed — the worker now mounts a Kubernetes kubeconfig instead of the Docker socket
> - Existing tests and monitors continue to work without modification
>
> Please refer to the updated [self-hosted deployment guide](https://supercheck.io/docs/app/deployment/self-hosted) for step-by-step upgrade instructions.

### Added
- **Sandboxed execution with gVisor** — Test and monitor execution now runs inside gVisor-sandboxed Kubernetes pods, providing kernel-level isolation for all user-submitted scripts ([#276](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/issues/276))
- **Dynamic locations system** — Locations are now database-managed instead of hardcoded constants. Super Admins can add, edit, and enable/disable locations from the admin dashboard. Workers dynamically discover regional queues. Per-project location restrictions are available ([#248](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/issues/248), [#249](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/issues/249), [#250](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/issues/250))

### Changed
- **Execution model migration** — Replaced Docker socket-based container execution with Kubernetes Jobs running under gVisor. Workers now use a scoped kubeconfig instead of mounting the Docker socket
- Updated Docker Compose configuration — worker runs as non-root (UID 1000), read-only filesystem with tmpfs mounts, all capabilities dropped
- Worker services now use Kubernetes API for container lifecycle management, log streaming, and artifact extraction
- Improved deployment documentation with detailed infrastructure requirements and setup guides

### Fixed
- Improved dynamic worker stability — fixed queue discovery retry loops, heartbeat timing windows, stale queue cleanup, and graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable
- Fixed multi-recipient alert email delivery for comma-separated email channels by sending messages sequentially over SMTP and reporting partial delivery failures accurately ([#269](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/issues/269))

### Security
- **gVisor sandboxing** — All user-submitted test scripts now execute under gVisor's userspace kernel, replacing the previous shared-kernel Docker isolation
- Worker containers run with restricted Pod Security Standards — non-root user, read-only filesystem, all capabilities dropped, no privilege escalation
- Network policies restrict execution pods from accessing internal services and cloud metadata endpoints
- Updated Next.js to 16.1.7 — fixes request smuggling, CSRF bypass, and DoS vulnerabilities
- Patched fast-xml-parser, file-type, yauzl, flatted, and ajv for various CVEs and DoS vulnerabilities


## [1.3.2] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Registration controls for self-hosted deployments** — New `SIGNUP_ENABLED` environment variable to enable/disable new user registration, and `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS` to restrict signup to specific email domains ([#246](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/issues/246))
- **Organization rename** — Organization owners and admins can now rename their organization from the Organization Admin page ([#247](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/issues/247))
- Added a UI callout on the self-hosted sign-up page to inform users about organization invitations
- **Status page support contact CTA** — Public status pages and incident notifications can now expose a `Get in touch` action backed by either an email address or a support URL ([#263](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/issues/263))

### Changed
- Streamlined admin interface by removing unused user creation functionality ([#245](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/issues/245))
- Clarified self-hosted scaling semantics across deployment docs and compose templates: `RUNNING_CAPACITY` and `QUEUED_CAPACITY` are App-side gating controls, while `WORKER_REPLICAS` remains the worker-side scaling knob
- Improved admin impersonation handling and session management flows
- Moved public status page branding suppression to a deployment-wide `STATUS_PAGE_HIDE_BRANDING` environment variable, removed the per-status-page settings toggle, and defaulted branding to visible unless the env var is set to `true`
- Updated public status page branding to use the Supercheck logo
- Reduced the monitor form name minimum from 10 to 3 characters to better support short operational labels ([#259](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/discussions/259))

### Fixed
- Fixed Playwright report loading performance. Implemented report caching across Playground, Runs, and Monitor views to prevent unnecessary re-fetching on tab switches
- Prevented caching of error responses from report proxy to avoid stale missing-report states after uploads complete
- Fixed false "Queue capacity limit reached" errors during Redis Sentinel failover
- Improved self-hosted migration script performance and hardened database creation commands against SQL injection
- Fixed worker Redis documentation to use correct `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, and `REDIS_PASSWORD` variables instead of `REDIS_URL` for multi-location deployments ([#252](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/issues/252))
- Improved invitation onboarding flow and RBAC/session initialization: unauthenticated invitees now redirect to `/sign-up?invite=...` (with sign-in fallback for existing users), project selections are normalized and project-scope validated, `org_admin` invitations are restricted to org owners, expired pending invites are ignored in duplicate checks, and acceptance now initializes an active project context ([#254](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/issues/254))
- Hardened admin user deletion to handle dependent user-owned foreign key references inside a transaction ([#254](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/issues/254))
- Fixed status page support contact UX so `Get in touch` matches the `Subscribe` button styling, stays in the top action area on incident pages, and handles `mailto:` links consistently across public views and emails ([#263](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/issues/263))
- Fixed status page settings persistence so support contact, headline, and description can be cleared reliably and reflect immediately after save
- Added a failed linked monitors overview card on status pages so operators can see linked monitor failures without paging through the full monitor table ([#259](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/discussions/259))

### Security
- Fixed DoS vulnerability in underscore via unlimited recursion in `_.flatten` and `_.isEqual` (patched to 1.13.8)
- Fixed DoS vulnerabilities in multer via resource exhaustion and incomplete cleanup (patched to 2.1.0)
- Fixed RCE vulnerability in serialize-javascript via `RegExp.flags` and `Date.prototype.toISOString()` (patched to 7.0.3)
- Fixed stack overflow vulnerability in fast-xml-parser `XMLBuilder` with `preserveOrder` (patched to 5.3.8)
- Fixed ReDoS vulnerability in minimatch via combinatorial backtracking in `matchOne()` with non-adjacent GLOBSTAR segments (patched via dependency overrides)
