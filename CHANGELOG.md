## [1.3.3] - [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Dynamic locations system** — Locations are now managed via the database instead of hardcoded constants. Super Admins can add, edit, and enable/disable locations from the admin dashboard. Workers dynamically discover regional queues from Redis and DB. Per-project location restrictions are available. Old hardcoded location constants (`MONITORING_LOCATIONS`, `REGIONS`, `K6_LOCATIONS`, `LOCATION_METADATA`) have been removed ([#248](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/issues/248), [#249](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/issues/249), [#250](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/issues/250))

### Fixed
- Fixed email notification test connection only sending to the first email address when multiple addresses are configured ([#269](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/issues/269))

### Security
- Updated Next.js from 16.1.6 to 16.1.7 — fixes HTTP request smuggling in rewrites, CSRF bypass via null origin, DoS via unbounded postponed resume buffering, and HMR websocket CSRF bypass
- Updated fast-xml-parser from 5.3.8 to 5.5.6 — fixes CVE-2026-26278 (numeric entity expansion bypassing entity expansion limits)
- Added override for file-type ≥21.3.2 — fixes ZIP decompression bomb DoS and infinite loop in ASF parser
- Added override for yauzl ≥3.2.1 — fixes off-by-one error
- Added override for flatted ≥3.4.0 — fixes unbounded recursion DoS in parse() revive phase
- Added override for ajv ^8 → 8.18.0 — fixes ReDoS when using `$data` option


## [1.3.2] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Registration controls for self-hosted deployments** — New `SIGNUP_ENABLED` environment variable to enable/disable new user registration, and `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS` to restrict signup to specific email domains ([#246](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/issues/246))
- **Organization rename** — Organization owners and admins can now rename their organization from the Organization Admin page ([#247](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/issues/247))
- Added a UI callout on the self-hosted sign-up page to inform users about organization invitations
- **Status page support contact CTA** — Public status pages and incident notifications can now expose a `Get in touch` action backed by either an email address or a support URL ([#263](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/issues/263))

### Changed
- Streamlined admin interface by removing unused user creation functionality ([#245](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/issues/245))
- Clarified self-hosted scaling semantics across deployment docs and compose templates: `RUNNING_CAPACITY` and `QUEUED_CAPACITY` are App-side gating controls, while `WORKER_REPLICAS` remains the worker-side scaling knob
- Improved admin impersonation handling and session management flows
- Moved public status page branding suppression to a deployment-wide `STATUS_PAGE_HIDE_BRANDING` environment variable, removed the per-status-page settings toggle, and defaulted branding to visible unless the env var is set to `true`
- Updated public status page branding to use the Supercheck logo
- Reduced the monitor form name minimum from 10 to 3 characters to better support short operational labels ([#259](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/discussions/259))

### Fixed
- Fixed Playwright report loading performance. Implemented report caching across Playground, Runs, and Monitor views to prevent unnecessary re-fetching on tab switches
- Prevented caching of error responses from report proxy to avoid stale missing-report states after uploads complete
- Prevented setting a status page custom domain to `STATUS_PAGE_DOMAIN` or its subdomains, which would silently fail to route ([#253](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/issues/253))
- Added catch-all Traefik routers to `docker-compose-secure.yml` and `docker-compose-external.yml` for custom domain support on status pages
- Fixed false "Queue capacity limit reached" errors during Redis Sentinel failover
- Improved self-hosted migration script performance and hardened database creation commands against SQL injection
- Fixed worker Redis documentation to use correct `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, and `REDIS_PASSWORD` variables instead of `REDIS_URL` for multi-location deployments ([#252](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/issues/252))
- Improved invitation onboarding flow and RBAC/session initialization: unauthenticated invitees now redirect to `/sign-up?invite=...` (with sign-in fallback for existing users), project selections are normalized and project-scope validated, `org_admin` invitations are restricted to org owners, expired pending invites are ignored in duplicate checks, and acceptance now initializes an active project context ([#254](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/issues/254))
- Hardened admin user deletion to handle dependent user-owned foreign key references inside a transaction ([#254](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/issues/254))
- Fixed status page support contact UX so `Get in touch` matches the `Subscribe` button styling, stays in the top action area on incident pages, and handles `mailto:` links consistently across public views and emails ([#263](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/issues/263))
- Fixed status page settings persistence so support contact, headline, and description can be cleared reliably and reflect immediately after save
- Added a failed linked monitors overview card on status pages so operators can see linked monitor failures without paging through the full monitor table ([#259](https://github.com/supercheck-io/supercheck/discussions/259))

### Security
- Fixed DoS vulnerability in underscore via unlimited recursion in `_.flatten` and `_.isEqual` (patched to 1.13.8)
- Fixed DoS vulnerabilities in multer via resource exhaustion and incomplete cleanup (patched to 2.1.0)
- Fixed RCE vulnerability in serialize-javascript via `RegExp.flags` and `Date.prototype.toISOString()` (patched to 7.0.3)
