# Security Module - gVisor Execution

This module is the worker-side execution boundary for untrusted Playwright and k6 code.

## Overview

`ContainerExecutorService` no longer shells out to Docker. The worker now creates a per-run Kubernetes Job in `supercheck-execution`, and the execution container runs under gVisor (`runtimeClassName: gvisor`).

The long-lived worker remains a control plane only:

- Prepares inline scripts and runtime environment
- Creates and watches execution Jobs through `@kubernetes/client-node`
- Streams logs back to callers
- Extracts reports from the still-running pod
- Uploads artifacts, then deletes the Job

## Security Model

Execution pods are hardened in multiple layers:

- `runtimeClassName: gvisor` for userspace-kernel syscall isolation
- `runAsNonRoot: true`, `runAsUser: 1000`, `runAsGroup: 1000`
- `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`
- `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`
- `capabilities.drop: ["ALL"]`
- `seccompProfile.type: RuntimeDefault`
- `automountServiceAccountToken: false`
- `enableServiceLinks: false`

The worker ServiceAccount has namespace-scoped RBAC only for:

- `jobs`
- `pods`
- `pods/log`
- `pods/exec`

Execution pods do not receive Kubernetes credentials.

## Workspace Isolation

Each run gets a unique workspace under `/tmp/supercheck/run-{hash}`.

- Caller-supplied `/tmp/...` paths are rewritten into that workspace
- Additional files are normalized to stay inside the workspace
- Artifact extraction is refused if the resolved path escapes the workspace
- `/dev/shm` is provided as a dedicated `emptyDir` tmpfs for Chromium

This prevents cross-run file contamination and makes cleanup deterministic when the Job is deleted.

## Artifact Extraction

The worker keeps the pod alive briefly after the user process exits:

1. The wrapper script records the real exit code to a file.
2. The worker polls that file via `pods/exec`.
3. The worker streams a tar archive of the requested report directory.
4. Tar entries are validated before extraction.
5. The worker signals the pod to exit and deletes the Job.

Safety checks include:

- Max artifact archive size: 100 MB
- Reject absolute paths and `..` traversal
- Reject symlinks, hard links, devices, FIFOs, and other unsafe tar entry types

## Resource Model

The public execution API still accepts:

- `memoryLimitMb`
- `cpuLimit`
- `timeoutMs`

The Kubernetes pod spec adds execution overhead automatically:

- `512 Mi` for `/dev/shm`
- `150 Mi` for gVisor Sentry overhead

This avoids under-sizing the pod compared with the caller-visible memory budget.

## DNS and Networking

Execution pods default to:

- `dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst`
- `dnsConfig.options: ndots=1, timeout=2, attempts=3`

If `EXECUTION_DNS_NAMESERVERS` is set on the worker, execution pods switch to `dnsPolicy: None` with those validated IPv4 nameservers.

Network access is enforced by Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy`, not by Docker flags:

- No inbound traffic
- DNS allowed
- Outbound TCP allowed only to public IPs
- Private ranges, metadata endpoints, and link-local addresses blocked

## Operational Notes

- Cancellation deletes the Job and forces exit code `137`
- Completion is determined by exit-code polling, not by log-stream lifecycle
- Log follow reconnects automatically; the worker also fetches a final snapshot
- `stderr` is not separated by Kubernetes log streaming and is folded into `stdout`
